    "As a major sector of the economy, the real estate market is highly dependent on several factors to achieve success, mainly precise house price forecasts. A real estate agency in King County, Washington state is looking for help in determining the primary factors that affect property values within the region. This project uses data from the King County House Sales dataset, which contains past real estate sales data that includes information on a variety of properties such as the previous sale price, the grade of the home and the year of construction. Some of the challenges that affect the real estate market are economic downturns like decrease in demand of property or increase in housing prices causing challenges of affordability and insufficient data that makes it difficult to make a recommendation system. A solution would be to create a combination of several multiple linear regression models in order to identify trends in the data. The project's objective is to create a thorough advice system for the agency that will help homeowners understand how house renovations may affect the estimated worth of their properties. "

Based on the particular characteristics of the homeowner's property, we will use data analytics and predictive modeling through simple and multiple linear regression approaches to; help homeowners accurately assess the value of their own houses, investors find potentially discounted properties, and real estate agents will be able to counsel their customers on pricing approaches by predicting home prices with ease."
